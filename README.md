# ANZLIC-Metadata-tool-for-ArcGIS
The ANZLIC Metadata tool uses the ISO 19139 (2005) metadata standard which is the current supported metadata standard used in Australia in its ArcGIS Desktop version 10.5 software package.  This metadata tool is intended to be used through the ArcGIS Desktop version 10.5 software accessed via the description tab in ArcCatalog.

The tool was previously developed and supported by Esri Australia but this was formally handed over to ANZLIC in 2017.  Geoscience Australia in support of ANZLIC has developed this new metadata tool based on the previous work of Esri Australia and the new Esri Inc ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 Metadata toolkit.

The tool is intended for users of Esri Inc ArcGIS Desktop version 10.5 software to create ANZLIC compliant ISO 19139 metadata associated with datasets.
